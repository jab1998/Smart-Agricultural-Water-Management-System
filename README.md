# Smart-Agricultural-Water-Management-System

We have developed a system so that the agricultural farmers can switch ON and OFF the motor in their fields through the our website or mobile app.

--> This project is done using Web2py.

--> The farmers can receive the soil moisture level of their field through SMS.

--> The switching of the motor can be kept in two modes Automatic(System switches the motor itself by analysing the moisture level) or Manual(The farmer needs to give the ON or OFF command from the webapp provided.)
